# Public Holidays
This is an exploration of public international holidays data provided by the [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/swagger/index.html). There are four primary files in this repository:

1. scrape_holidays.py - this Python file accesses the API, formats the resulting JSON data, and outputs the data to a CSV file
2. holidays.csv - this is the CSV file containing public holidays for 2023 and 2024
3. holiday_script.py - this Python file creates several functions that output information about holidays around the world
4. Examples.ipynb - this Jupyter Notebook runs holiday_script.py to demonstrate the type of output that the code generates
